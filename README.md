# Project Overview
In this term project, I aim to investigate how urbanization, starting from year 1960, affected average human height by analyzing data of possible parameters such as income levels, daily supply of calories per person, healthcare access, child mortality rates etc. Motivation behind this study is to associate my collective interest in how urbanization has influenced quality of life through several aspects to a health-related parameter, average height, as an indicator of physical development. By examining data that I will collect about various factors and determine whether there exists a correlation between share of people living in urban and rural areas and average height throughout the years.

# Methods
I started with determining the research area that I am interested in so that I can continue to search on and collect data about it. While collecting data I paid attention to whether I can relate and use this data to my goal of finding a correlation. After data collection is finished, I will apply the techniques and skills in terms of data processing and testing methods that will be covered throughout the semester to the data and reach a result.

# Details of the Dataset
The dataset that will be examined in this study encompasses information from economical, social and physical factors that can possibly be beneficial in the process of investigating the ultimate correlation between urbanization and average human height. These factors can be listed as follows:

1. Income levels / GDP per capita: Higher income level might lead to better nutrition which would contribute to physical development.

2. Daily supply of calories per person: Change in calorie availability could indicate diet conditions of the people.

3. Agricultural productivity: More productive agriculture would result in an increase in calorie availability and, consequently, better nutrition.

4. Percentage of population engaged in farming: Urbanization affecting the rates of people living in rural and urban areas would impact production that can lead to less quality food whereas rural areas are known for access to fresh food.

5. Consumption of processed vs. whole foods: Higher processed food consumption in urban areas may influence child nutrition and growth.

6. Malnutrition rates: Rural and urban populations can be compared in terms of access to quality food leading to a better diet.

7. Child mortality rates: Rates of child mortality might be used as an indicator of sufficient healthcare conditions.

8. Healthcare access: Change in level of healthcare access availability may show how people benefited from this change by providing their children better control of health.

9. Prevalence of childhood diseases: Frequent illnesses in childhood can harm growth and eventually affect height.

10. Access to electricity/water/sanitation: Disparities in access to (clean) sources and distress that it can cause in terms of health (diseases etc.) might lead to distinction in child growth throughout generations.

11. Air pollution level: Increase in air pollution may hinder child growth by causing harm for health.

12. Childhood stress levels: Significantly higher level of stress can lead to hormonal changes that can hinder growth.

13. Sedentary lifestyles: Rural populations are known for engaging more in physical labor which can impact body development (bones, muscles etc.).

14. Average human height: This is the ultimate parameter for which I hope to find a correlation between urbanization. Above parameters will be examined in the expectation of a correlation.

# Expected Outcomes:
I anticipate to find a positive correlation between level of urbanization and average human height based on improved health (healthcare access, child mortality), economical (income level) and diet (malnutrition rates, food consumption) conditions due to increasing urban population.

----

# Hypotheses:
Null hypothesis: Urbanization tends to correlate positively with average human height thanks to higher income levels, improved healthcare conditions and better nutrition.

Alternative hypothesis: Urbanization has no significant relationship with or negative impact on average human height, therefore it does not correlate positively due to factors such as air pollution, consumption of processed food, urban stress and sedentary lifestyles.
