# Project Overview
In this term project, I aim to investigate how urbanization, starting from year 1960, affected average human height by analyzing data of possible parameters such as income levels, daily supply of calories per person, healthcare access, child mortality rates etc. Motivation behind this study is to associate my collective interest in how urbanization has influenced quality of life through several aspects to a health-related parameter, average height, as an indicator of physical development. By examining data that I will collect about various factors and determine whether there exists a correlation between share of people living in urban and rural areas and average height throughout the years.
