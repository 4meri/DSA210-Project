# Project Overview
In this term project, I aim to investigate how urbanization, starting from year 1960, affected average human height by analyzing data of possible parameters such as income levels, daily supply of calories per person, healthcare access, child mortality rates etc. Motivation behind this study is to associate my collective interest in how urbanization has influenced quality of life through several aspects to a health-related parameter, average height, as an indicator of physical development. By examining data that I will collect about various factors and determine whether there exists a correlation between share of people living in urban and rural areas and average height throughout the years.

  # Methods


# Details of the Dataset
The dataset that will be examined in this study encompasses information from economical, social and physical factors that can possibly be beneficial in the process of investigating the ultimate correlation between urbanization and average human height. These factors can be listed as follows:

1. Income levels / GDP per capita: Higher income level might lead to better nutrition which would contribute to physical development.

2. Daily supply of calories per person: Change in calorie availability could indicate diet conditions of the people.
4. Agricultural productivity: More productive agriculture would result in an increase in calorie availability and, consequently, better nutrition.
5. Percentage of population engaged in farming: Urbanization affecting the rates of people living in rural and urban areas would impact production that can lead to less quality food whereas rural areas are known for access to fresh food.
6. Consumption of processed vs. whole foods: Higher processed food consumption in urban areas may influence child nutrition and growth.
7. Malnutrition rates: Rural and urban populations can be compared in terms of access to quality food leading to a better diet.
8. Child mortality rates: Rates of child mortality might be used as an indicator of sufficient healthcare conditions.
9. Healthcare access: Change in level of healthcare access availability may show how people benefited from this change by providing their children better control of health.
10. Prevalence of childhood diseases: Frequent illnesses in childhood can harm growth and eventually affect height.
11. Access to electricity/water/sanitation:
12. Air pollution level:
13. Average human height:
